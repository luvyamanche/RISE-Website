            RISE (Rural Initiative for STEAM Education) is a nonprofit
            organization focused on access to STEAM education. We provide
            students with hands-on learning in science, technology, engineering,
            arts, and mathematics.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              We support local communities with practical kits including solar
              light kits for homes without electricity, water purification kits
              for areas with unsafe water, and educational kits for classrooms
              with limited resources.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Our approach is simple: we give students the tools to learn. We
              give communities the tools to solve problems. This way, young
              people gain skills while helping where they live.

              Our Origin Story
            </h3>
            <p className="text-blue-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
              The Rise Foundation began in 2022 during a volunteer trip to Ivory
              Coast. Local schools lacked textbooks, lab supplies, and
              electricity. Students wanted to learn but had no tools. Seeing
              these conditions inspired the founders to act.
            </p>
            <p className="text-blue-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
              That same year, a monsoon disaster in India revealed how
              communities suffer when basic resources fail. Children and
              families were forced to drink contaminated water, with no access
              to safe treatment. The crisis exposed global gaps in public health
              and education.
            </p>
            <p className="text-blue-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
              These experiences shaped the Rise Foundation's mission. What began
              as small kits of electronic parts for one school grew into
              scalable STEAM kits built for real-world needs. The kits include
              projects such as water purification and pH testing, designed for
              durability and affordability.
            </p>
            <p className="text-blue-100 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              Today, the foundation supports multiple schools and communities.
              Beyond providing supplies, the team builds programs that teach
              problem solving and practical science. Their goal is clear: expand
              access to knowledge and tools so no child is held back by lack of
              opportunity.
